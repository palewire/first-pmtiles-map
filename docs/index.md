# First PMTiles Map

Learn how to display a massive dataset on an interactive map using PMTiles and Maplibre

## What you will learn

This class will show you how journalists use free and open-source tools to:

- Convert massive shapefiles to the compact [PMTiles](https://github.com/protomaps/PMTiles) format using [tippecanoe](https://github.com/felt/tippecanoe)
- Display the tiles on an interactive map using [MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/projects/maplibre-gl-js/)
- Create a data-driven style that colors features based on their attributes

## Who can take it

This course is free. Anyone with access to a computer terminal is qualified. You don't need to be an expert programmer, but you will need to be comfortable using the command line and editing text files.

If you've never worked with a command-line interface, consider reviewing the [Software Carpentry's shell tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) first.
